gunicorn setup for production theCube on a server

1) Edit config/gunicorn.socket and gunicorn.service, change working directory
2) Copy or Link config/gunicorn.socket and gunicorn.service to /etc/systemd/system
3) sudo systemctl enable gunicorn.socket 
4) sudo systemctl start gunicorn.socket 

Thereafter, gunicorn will auto start/stop with system start/shutdown

If linking, make sure use absolute path,

    ln -s ~/work/backtest/config/gunicorn.socket /etc/systemd/system

Gunicorn works together with nginx to serve our backtest webapp.

Above config will make gunicorn listen at unix socket /run/gunicorn.socket and
nginx will listen to http port and redirect to gunicorn. Using sockets on same 
machine avoids the tcp overhead.
